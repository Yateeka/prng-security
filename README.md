# Breaking and Defending PRNGs: An Adversarial Approach

This project investigates the vulnerabilities of Java's `java.util.Random`, which relies on a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG). Through brute-force and adversarial attacks inspired by FGSM and PGD, we demonstrate how predictable and insecure this PRNG can be when used in security-critical applications.

We then introduce and validate a cryptographically secure alternative based on SHA-256, highlighting the importance of using proper entropy sources in software security.

## üîç Project Overview

- Simulates Java‚Äôs internal PRNG (`java.util.Random`) using an LCG-based Python class.
- Demonstrates seed recovery via:
  - Brute-force attack
  - FGSM-inspired perturbation
  - PGD-inspired iterative attack
- Visualizes attack paths and shows the ease of predictability.
- Implements and evaluates a secure SHA-256-based PRNG alternative (`SecureRNG`).
